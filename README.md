#  Creditworthiness Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts an individual's **creditworthiness** using financial data.  
Developed during the **CodeAlpha Internship**, it applies classification models to support smarter lending decisions.


##  Overview

- Preprocessed and analyzed financial data  
- Trained model: **Logistic Regression**
- Evaluated performance using **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-Score**, and **ROC-AUC**  
- Identified key features influencing creditworthiness


## Tools & Libraries

- Python, Jupyter Notebook  
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn  


## Results

- **Logistic Regression** gave the highest accuracy  
- But the but is bit overfit due to low amount of data and more coloums due to Label Encoding

## How to Run

1. Open `CodeAlpha_Creditworthiness.ipynb`  
2. Run all cells sequentially to train and evaluate model
